Readme
Walmart Sales Analysis (Tableau)
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Walmart's sales data using Tableau to uncover key insights into sales trends and store performance. The dashboard provides an interactive view of weekly sales trends and store-wise sales distribution.

📊 Key Insights
Sales Trends:

Weekly sales show fluctuations with major peaks, likely due to seasonal sales (e.g., Black Friday, holiday shopping).

Sales mostly remain between 40M to 50M, but spikes exceed 80M, indicating high-demand periods.

Post-peak sales tend to decline, suggesting possible demand saturation after promotions or holidays.

Store Performance:

The dashboard currently aggregates store-wise data; further breakdown is needed to analyze individual store performance.

More insights can be drawn by filtering stores and comparing their sales trends.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
